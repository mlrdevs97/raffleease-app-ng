## ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read [`PLANNING.md`](./PLANNING.md)** before starting a new conversation or task. It defines the projectâ€™s architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check [`TASK.md`](./TASK.md)** before beginning any task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a short description and todayâ€™s date.
- **Follow the project's naming conventions, folder structure, and architecture patterns** as defined in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Ensure the application provides meaningful user feedback** during all interactionsâ€”especially form submissions, navigation, loading states, and errors. Use clear validation messages, confirmations, and notifications to guide the user.

## ðŸ“š Documentation & Explainability

- **Update [`README.md`](./README.md)** when adding new features, changing dependencies, or modifying setup instructions.
- **Comment on non-obvious code** to ensure it's understandable to a mid-level developer.
- For complex logic, **include inline `# Reason:` comments** to explain the *why* behind implementation decisions.

## ðŸ¤– AI Agent Behavior Rules

- **Do not assume context.** Ask clarifying questions when information is missing or ambiguous.
- **Avoid hallucinating libraries or functions.** Use only well-known and verified packages or project-defined modules.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** before referencing them in code or documentation.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed or the task in `TASK.md` requires it.
